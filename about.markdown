Hello! My name is Nicole Franco Majakin, an IT enthusiast and working as an IT Specialist at the moment.

One of my daily tasks is to provide assistance in regards to IT equipment issue or inadequacy, on demand. I also help to replnish any consumables such as cartridges, AAA batteries for peripherals (usually for wireless mouse and keyboards), and cables. Most of requests are done through prompts or direct messages.

The first time I ever get to tinker a computer device inside and out is when I got my laptop wrecked by my brother. While being thankful that my laptop survived, I was sad that I had to use my laptop while connecting to an old CRT monitor. From there, I play around with its settings and also upgrade its RAM. I also had fun with Command Prompt as it was the only way I was able to have a compatible display resolution. And that still made me feel happy.

Since then, I was scourging for any resources online to learn more about IT. There were a lot of MOOCs' courses available online for free, range from "Troubleshooting Computer Hardware" to  "Linux for Beginners" to "Learn Web Development". The most prominent ones were SoloLearn, Codecademy and edX (or at least those were the ones I often go for, sadly I only manage to finish their fundamentals).

Now, I'm more than glad that almost all about IT are available online, for free, or better, paid to support the efforts of making IT accessible to everyone.
